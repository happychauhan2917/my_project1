    <h2>Our Journey 🌱</h2>
    <p style="max-width:750px; margin-top:20px;">
      Every confident step I take today started from small moments on school stages.
      This journey is not just about events — it’s about growth, courage, and learning.
    </p>

<!-- BEGINNING -->
<section class="services" style="background:#f9f3ea;">
  <h2>Where It All Began 🎤</h2>
  <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
    My journey began during my school years when I first stepped on stage.
    Hosting assemblies, annual functions, and school events helped me discover
    my love for microphones, audiences, and live energy.
    <br><br>
    Those early experiences taught me confidence, voice control,
    and the importance of preparation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- GROWTH -->
<section class="services">
  <h2>Learning & Growing ✨</h2>
  <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
    With time, my responsibilities grew.
    I learned that hosting is not just about speaking well,
    but also about coordination, time management, and understanding the flow of an event.
    <br><br>
    From handling unexpected situations to keeping audiences engaged,
    each event helped me grow stronger and more confident.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- HIGHLIGHT MOMENT -->
<section class="services" style="background:#f9f3ea;">
  <h2>A Defining Moment 🏆</h2>
  <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
    Being crowned <strong>Miss Farewell</strong> was a special milestone in my journey.
    It represented confidence, presence, and the trust people placed in me on stage.
    <br><br>
    That moment motivated me to take events more seriously —
    not just as participation, but as a professional path.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TODAY -->
<section class="services">
  <h2>Where We Stand Today 🤍</h2>
  <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
    Today, We continue to explore event hosting and management with a clearer vision.
    we focus on building meaningful experiences, learning the business side of events,
    and growing Happy Events step by step.
    <br><br>
    Our journey is still in progress — and every event adds a new chapter.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CLOSING -->
<section class="services" style="background:#f9f3ea;">
  <h2>This Is Just the Beginning ✨</h2>
  <p style="max-width:700px; margin:auto;">
    What started as a passion has now become a purpose.
    With dedication, creativity, and consistency,
    I look forward to everything that lies ahead.
